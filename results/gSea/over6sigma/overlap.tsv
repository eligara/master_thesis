GO_OLFACTORY_RECEPTOR_ACTIVITY	425	Combining with an odorant and transmitting the signal from one side of the membrane to the other to initiate a change in cell activity in response to detection of smell.	7	0.0165	7.89E-8	9.41E-4
GO_DETECTION_OF_STIMULUS	675	The series of events in which a stimulus is received by a cell or organism and converted into a molecular signal.	8	0.0119	1.06E-7	9.41E-4
GO_SENSORY_PERCEPTION_OF_CHEMICAL_STIMULUS	524	The series of events required for an organism to receive a sensory chemical stimulus, convert it to a molecular signal, and recognize and characterize the signal. This is a neurological process.	7	0.0134	3.24E-7	1.92E-3
GO_G_PROTEIN_COUPLED_RECEPTOR_SIGNALING_PATHWAY	1193	A series of molecular signals that proceeds with an activated receptor promoting the exchange of GDP for GTP on the alpha-subunit of an associated heterotrimeric G-protein complex. The GTP-bound activated alpha-G-protein then dissociates from the beta- and gamma-subunits to further transmit the signal within the cell. The pathway begins with receptor-ligand interaction, or for basal GPCR signaling the pathway begins with the receptor activating its G protein in the absence of an agonist, and ends with regulation of a downstream cellular process, e.g. transcription.  The pathway can start from the plasma membrane, Golgi or nuclear membrane (PMID:24568158 and PMID:16902576).	9	0.0075	6.89E-7	2.77E-3
GO_G_PROTEIN_COUPLED_RECEPTOR_ACTIVITY	879	Combining with an extracellular signal and transmitting the signal across the membrane by activating an associated G-protein; promotes the exchange of GDP for GTP on the alpha subunit of a heterotrimeric G-protein complex.	8	0.0091	7.76E-7	2.77E-3
GO_SENSORY_PERCEPTION	938	The series of events required for an organism to receive a sensory stimulus, convert it to a molecular signal, and recognize and characterize the signal. This is a neurological process.	8	0.0085	1.26E-6	3.74E-3
GO_NEUROLOGICAL_SYSTEM_PROCESS	1242	A organ system process carried out by any of the organs or tissues of neurological system.	8	0.0064	9.92E-6	2.52E-2
